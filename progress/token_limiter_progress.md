# 🚀 Distributed Rate Limiter Project Tracker (v2)

---

# 📌 PROJECT CHARTER

## Project Title

**Distributed Rate Limiter Service**
(Token Bucket + Sliding Window)

---

## Project Goal

Build a production-style backend systems project capable of enforcing rate limits across multiple clients while maintaining correctness under concurrent access.

The project should demonstrate:

* Backend Development
* REST API Design
* Redis Integration
* Concurrency Handling
* Distributed State Management
* Rate Limiting Algorithms
* Docker Containerization
* Load Testing
* Deployment
* Technical Documentation

---

## Why This Project Exists

Most student projects are CRUD applications.

This project focuses on:

* Shared State
* Concurrency
* Atomic Operations
* System Design
* Infrastructure Concepts

The objective is not simply to implement a rate limiter.

The objective is to understand how production systems prevent abuse, manage shared resources, and maintain correctness under load.

---

## Why Go + Gin + Redis + Docker

### Go

Chosen because:

* Simple backend development
* Excellent concurrency model
* Minimal boilerplate
* Widely used in infrastructure software

### Gin

Chosen because:

* Lightweight
* Easy routing
* Fast setup
* Industry adoption

### Redis

Chosen because:

* Extremely fast
* Persistence support
* Atomic operations
* Lua scripting support

### Docker

Chosen because:

* Consistent environments
* Easy deployment
* Industry standard

---

## Resume Target

By completion, this project should be strong enough to appear as a major backend project on internship resumes.

Expected Resume Bullet:

> Built a distributed rate limiter service in Go using Token Bucket and Sliding Window algorithms, Redis-backed persistence, atomic Lua scripting, Docker containerization, and load testing under concurrent traffic.

---

## MVP Checkpoint (Day 6)

By Day 6 the project should support:

* Token Bucket
* Redis Persistence
* Atomic Lua Script

## Day 4 — HTTP Fundamentals + Gin Framework

Date:

2026-07-07

Hours Spent:

~3–4 Hours

Topics Learned:

* HTTP Request / Response Flow
* HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Status Codes (200, 400, 404, 429, 500)
* Headers (conceptual understanding)
* JSON structure (keys, values, objects)
* Installing and using Gin (`go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin`)
* Building a Gin server with `gin.Default()` and `router.Run(":8080")`
* Query Parameters (`c.Query("name")`)
* Path Parameters (`c.Param("id")`)
* Difference between query params and path params
* Manual testing via browser

Files Created:

* main.go (updated with Gin routes)

Endpoints Built:

```text
GET /ping
GET /hello
GET /user?name=om
GET /user/:id
```

Problems Faced:

* None blocking — completed without major issues

Key Learnings:

* `router := gin.Default()` creates the server instance
* `router.GET(...)` registers a route handler for incoming GET requests
* `c.JSON(...)` sends a JSON response back to the client
* Query parameters (`?name=om`) and path parameters (`/user/123`) are handled differently but serve a similar purpose
* This exact query-parameter mechanism (`?client_id=abc`) is what the future `/check` endpoint will rely on

Git Commit Created:

Yes

Commit:

feat: gin hello world

Outcome:

✅ Understood HTTP request/response flow

✅ Understood GET/POST and status codes

✅ Understood JSON structure

✅ Installed Gin

✅ Built a running API with 4 working endpoints

✅ Handled query parameters and path parameters

✅ Tested all endpoints successfully in browser

✅ Commit pushed: "feat: gin hello world"

Next Objective:

Redis Fundamentals — Redis Data Types, Persistence, Containers, Go ↔ Redis Connectivity

---

## Day 5 — Redis Fundamentals

Date:

2026-07-07

Hours Spent:

~3 Hours

Topics Learned:

* What Redis actually is — conceptually, a `map[string]string` living outside the application
* Why Redis exists: application memory disappears on restart, so token counts can't live only in a Go variable
* Why multiple Go server instances need a shared store instead of separate in-process maps
* Redis Data Types (conceptual only, not deep): String, Hash, Sorted Set
* String → simple key/value (e.g. `username = om`)
* Hash → grouped fields under one key (e.g. `user:1 → name, age`)
* Sorted Set → values with scores (previewed for future Sliding Window use)
* Why Redis is run in Docker instead of installed directly (environment consistency, matches real company practice)
* Docker commands conceptually: `docker pull redis`, `docker run redis`, `docker ps`
* Redis client for Go: `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9`
* `client := redis.NewClient(...)` creates the connection
* Performing a `SET` and `GET` from a Go program and printing the retrieved value
* How today's `username = om` exercise maps directly onto the future rate limiter schema (`client:{id} → tokens, last_refill`) — same mechanism, different data

Files Created:

* main.go (updated with Redis connection, SET, and GET logic)

Problems Faced:

* None blocking — completed without major issues

Key Learnings:

* Redis is an in-memory database used to store state outside the Go application
* A rate limiter needs Redis because token counts must survive requests and server restarts
* Go maps are insufficient because they vanish on restart and can't be shared across multiple server instances
* The Go Redis client (`go-redis/v9`) handles the connection; `SET`/`GET` round-trip correctly from Go to Redis and back
* Today's exercise (`username = om`) is functionally identical to the future bucket state (`tokens`, `last_refill`) — only the data changes, not the mechanism

Git Commit Created:

Yes

Commit:

feat: redis connectivity

Outcome:

✅ Redis container running locally

✅ Go application successfully connected to Redis

✅ Performed SET from Go

✅ Performed GET from Go

✅ Retrieved value printed and verified correct

✅ Understood why Redis exists and why Go maps are insufficient

✅ Commit pushed: "feat: redis connectivity"

Next Objective:

Token Bucket — Refill Logic, Consumption Logic, Burst Handling (In-Memory Token Bucket)

---

# 🎯 CURRENT MILESTONE

## Token Bucket

Objectives:

* Refill Logic
* Consumption Logic
* Burst Handling

Deliverable:

In-Memory Token Bucket

Completion Criteria:

* Implement refill logic based on elapsed time and rate
* Implement consumption logic that decrements available tokens
* Handle burst capacity correctly (cap at max tokens)
* Verify behavior with a simple in-memory (non-Redis) prototype before wiring in Redis/Lua

Status:

⏳ In Progress
